freecodecamp first responsive web design project
This is a repository for my freecodecamp responsive web design projects.
There are 5 projects in total
The first is a tribute page 
The second is a survey form
The third is a product landing page
The fourth is a technical documentation
Finally, the fifth is a personal portfolio project
I am uploading these projects to github so that i can include the code for the first 4 projects into the portfolio project.
All the projects have the projects tester that freecodecamp provides as so that learners can meet all the requirements of the project.
I have met all requirements of the test for each project. However, i have noticed that sometimes it will say not all requirements are met.
I think this is because of testing too fast and not giving the page enough time to load.
